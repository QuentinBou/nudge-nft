        <h2>So, what is NFT ?</h2>
        <p>NFT is short for NON-FUNGIBLE-TOKEN. That probably doesn't mean much at this point; the word "fungible" is not particularly common. However, it basically means that something is interchangeable.</p>
        <p>For example, in economics, money is a fungible asset. It is endowed with units and can be easily exchanged (for example, a €20 note for two €10 notes) without losing or gaining value. Fungible assets also include things like gold, cryptocurrencies, and stocks.</p>
        <p>A fungible asset is something that can be divided in many different ways, and there can be unlimited supply. They can be used in a myriad of ways, such as for payments or to store value.</p>
        <p>A non-fungible asset, on the other hand, is a single piece, such as a painting, a house or a trading card, for example. Although a painting, for example, can be copied or photographed, the original remains the original, and replicas do not have the same value.</p>
        <p>NFTs are units of data stored on a blockchain digital ledger. Each non-fungible token acts as a sort of certificate of authenticity, showing that a digital asset is unique and not interchangeable. An NFT can never be modified, adjusted or stolen, thanks to the principles of cryptography that make the blockchain unique.</p>
