          <h2>What is BlockChain ?</h2>
          <p>A blockchain is a type of database – a collection of electronically stored information or data.</p>
          <p>Unlike a traditional database, a blockchain is a series of interconnected “blocks” of data. This blockchain creates a shared digital ledger (collection of data) that records activity and information within the blockchain.</p>
          <p>Each blockchain ledger is stored worldwide on thousands of different servers. This means anyone on the network can see (and verify) everyone else's entries. This peer-to-peer and distributed ledger technology, as it is called, means that it is virtually impossible to tamper with or tamper with the data in a block.</p>
          <p>To use IBM's definition, the blockchain is a shared and immutable (permanent and unalterable) ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets.</p>
          <p>When we think of NFTs, they are created on a blockchain and can never be taken into a separate blockchain ecosystem. They will exist on this blockchain and prove the authenticity of the good you have purchased.</p>
