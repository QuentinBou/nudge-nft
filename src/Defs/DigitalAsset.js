        <h2>What is a Digital Asset ?</h2>
        <p>Simply put, a digital asset is anything that exists in a digital format and has a right of use (a right to copy, duplicate, reproduce, modify, and otherwise use). So, for example, things like documents, audio or visual content, images, and other similar digital data are all considered digital assets.</p>
